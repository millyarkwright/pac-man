          <p>This is a story of a man called Theseus, destined to become one of the greatest heroes in Greek mythology.</p>
          
          <p>The Minotaur was a man with the head of a bull: the product of a rather twisted coupling between Pasiphaë, Minos’ wife, and a ferocious bull that Poseidon had brought out of the sea so that Minos could sacrifice it to him. However, Minos was so taken by the bull – a handsome beast, and useful to have as stud for his cattle – that he sacrificed a different animal and hoped Poseidon wouldn’t notice.</p>
            
          <p>It’s always a bad idea to hope that a god won’t notice your trickery, and sure enough, Poseidon wasn’t fooled. So he made the bull so savage that it was a menace to Minos, and Pasiphaë, Minos’ wife, desired the bull. She asked Daedelus, her husband’s master craftsman, to help her with her dilemma, and he created a cow made of wood and leather into which Pasiphaë could climb and then … mate with the bull. Whatever floats your boat, eh? </p> 
          
          <p>The result of this rather bestial union was the Minotaur, a fierce creature who worried Minos, so he told Daedelus to build a vast palace comprising a maze-like network of corridors and rooms, and then he had the Minotaur placed inside this palace.
          </p> 

          <p>According to the myth, Minos imprisoned his enemies in the Labyrinth so the Minotaur could eat them. The labyrinth was such a complicated construction that no one could ever find the way out alive.
          </p> 

          <p>One year, Minos’ son, Androgens, went to Athens to take part int he Panathenaic games, but was killed during the Marathon but he bull that impregnated his moth Pasiphae. Minos subsequently demanded that Aegeus, King of Athens, to send seven men and women to the Minotaur.
