## Daily Overview  

Day 1

Once the project had been introduced and I'd chosen pac-man as my game, I spent the rest of the day brainstorming and planning the project: 
* Created wireframes 
* Created a Trello board, created lists for each day of the project and added the tasks I wanted to complete by each day to the lists. 
* Listed out expected elements I would need to target: 
* Listed out expected variables I would need: 
* Listed out expected executions: 
* Listed out expected event listeners: 
* Created wireframes for the main page as well as win/lose pop-up and myth story overlay:

* Play button to start the monster’s movement 
* Click to read the full story article at the bottom of the intro-wrapper would open a previously hidden  section that would be overlayed over the main element.
